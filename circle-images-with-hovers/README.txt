 I'm currently working on a project where there will be some images as circles that will reveal a name when you hover over them. I wanted to create something where it would be easy to update within an editor (like Wordpress) and not have to use CSS sprites or background images for the transitions and hovers. 
Yeah, I know, I have a thing for the Fill Murray, but ya know...it's fun!
